### Changes:
- Set up local Git repository on Windows.
- Linked local Git repository to GitHub.
- Verified GitHub integration by pushing and pulling changes.
- Set up `cs1` environment to pull updates from the GitHub repository.
- Tested syncing files between local, GitHub, and `cs1`.

### Next Steps:
- Start implementing file operations (`create_file`, `save_file`, `load_file`).
- Test basic file creation locally and on `cs1`.

### Session Start
**Thoughts so far:**  
The project has progressed significantly. The core functionality of the B-Tree is now implemented, and the integration with the file operations and main program is working well. Recent testing has highlighted the importance of properly handling edge cases, such as corrupted files and invalid inputs.

**Plan for this session:**  
1. Review and document all the changes made during the implementation of the `feature-B-Tree` branch.  
   - Detail updates to `btree.py`, `main.py`, and `file_operations.py`.  
   - Include descriptions of the new test files: `test_btree.py`, `test_file_operations.py`, and `corrupt-invalid_file_genererator.py`.  
2. Verify that all commands (`CREATE`, `OPEN`, `INSERT`, `SEARCH`, etc.) work as described in the project requirements.  
3. Test the integration on `cs1` to confirm compatibility with the environment.  
4. Prepare for merging the `feature-B-Tree` branch into `main`.  
5. Update the `README.md` with detailed instructions and examples.

### During the Session
**Progress/Challenges:**  
- Successfully tested `btree.py` functionalities such as insertion, traversal, and search, including edge cases like duplicate keys and corrupted files.  
- Found and fixed a minor issue with file overwriting prompts in `main.py`.  
- Verified compatibility with the `cs1` environment by testing file paths and using `python3` where necessary.  
- Finalized the `README.md` to include all necessary details for running and testing the project.  

**Key Learnings:**  
- Proper error handling for invalid inputs and corrupted files is critical for user experience.  
- Testing in different environments (Windows vs. `cs1`) is essential to ensure seamless portability.

### Session End
**Reflection:**  
- Goals for this session were accomplished:
  - Documented all changes made to the `feature-B-Tree` branch.
  - Verified functionality and compatibility on `cs1`.
  - Updated and finalized the `README.md`.  
- The project now meets the requirements specified in the assignment, including proper command implementation and file handling.  

**Next Steps:**  
1. Merge the `feature-B-Tree` branch into `main`.  
2. Conduct a final review of the assignment to ensure all specifications are fully addressed.  
3. make readme

### During the Session
**Progress/Challenges:**  
- Verified all functionalities, including edge case handling for invalid and corrupted files.  
- Ensured the `README.md` provides clear, concise instructions for setting up and running the project on both Windows and `cs1`.  
- Checked that the project structure is clean and well-organized. No unnecessary files are included (e.g., temporary test files or cache directories).  
- Prepared the zip file for submission.

**Key Learnings:**  
- Careful attention to detail during testing and documentation ensures that the project is complete and user-friendly.  
- Keeping the devlog up to date helps track progress and ensures all steps are properly documented.
